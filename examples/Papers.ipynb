       "   'abstract': '\\nResumenEl artículo defiende la necesidad de una política de mínimo extractivismo de recursos naturales renovables (RNR) y de recursos naturales no renovables (RNNR), teniendo en cuenta que los ingresos de las rentas del suelo y de las minas son ilícitos y fraudulentos, pues existe una apropiación arbitraria de recursos no producidos por el ser humano y sustraídos a la naturaleza, lo que tiende a empeorarse por graves fallas tanto en el mercado como en el Estado. De hecho, es imposible que los seres humanos sustituyan los recursos naturales, ya que los seres humanos solamente pueden producir instrumentos exosomáticos y labores que no pueden ni sustituir los recursos naturales ni generar materia o energía. Ante las alternativas de imponer elevados tributos a la actividad extractiva y aumentar las rentas del Estado se vislumbra la más radical opción de reducir a su mínima expresión la extracción de recursos naturales en aras de minimizar remordimientos futuros y propender por un sensato bienestar en el presente. Esta argumentación es el resultado de una lectura crítica de la teoría relevante, incluyendo versiones ortodoxas y heterodoxas, así como de distintas visiones de política pública en materia de recursos naturales.\\nPalabras clave\\n',\n",

The Taliban\\'s coercive approach and its entire reliance on \"war-making\" to \"state-making\" shows the difficulty of the transformation of an insurgent group into a state structure. The Taliban was primarily capable of establishing a two-track system of governance. However, the assessment of the IEA\\'s institutional and functional capabilities shows that the military-political organization formed by the Taliban lacked statehood in all three areas of legitimacy, authority and capacity.\\n',\n",

There are far too many people to thank, without whom this project would not have materialised.I am fortunate to have received several years of funding from an interdisciplinary research program called 'Towards Environmentally Sustainable and Equitable Palm Oil' funded by the Interdisciplinary Research and Education Fund (INREF) of Wageningen University. When I started considering PhD research, I could not imagine that I would finally embark on a sixyear journey of research and writing. I would say that in these six years, it has been a luxury to spend most of my time working as a researcher, while also struggling to secure a livelihood from short-time assignments. \\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\n102 Do We Need 195 Theories of Foreign Policy?    spelling out how precisely this is so is no less of a theoretical challenge than spelling out the state-specific peculiarities of the individual state.Against this background, this chapter will explore the possibilities of theorizing foreign policy in four steps. In a first step, I will provide a critical review of Rosenau's original call for country-specific theories in order to explicate the idea that a single-country focus is both necessary and insufficient. In a second step, I will discuss some of the requirements of country-specific theories (which are themselves only partially countryspecific). How is it possible to 'theorize a country' in the first place? What kinds of theoretical resources does this require, and what repercussions does any such attempt have on our understanding of theory? From the point of view of a standard deductive-nomological understanding of theory, such a quest would seem futile from the very beginning. Countries and their foreign policies are specific, theories trade in generalizations. To the extent that large-scale generalizations are the proper domain of IR, Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA) seems by definition less of a theoretical enterprise. Things look differently, however, if we adopt a more pluralist understanding of theory. From a reconstructive point of view, the systematic study of foreign policy in individual countries may render visible theoretical problems, which trade less in empirical generalizations, but by virtue of doing so, raise general problems pointing beyond the specificity of individual cases. 1 The particular requirements of country-specific theory, I thus contend, lead us straight into a confrontation between a form of substantive theorizing quite common among the classics of social theory, that is a form of theorizing which is directed immediately at the subject matter at hand and cannot be meaningfully disentangled from it, and an empiricist understanding of theory, which postulates an absolute hiatus between theory on the one hand, and empirics on the other. In a third step, having opted for a reconstructive, problem-driven understanding of country-specific theories of foreign policy, which departs significantly from Rosenau's original proposition (though maybe less so from his later work), I will develop the idea of nested foreign policies by calling for a focus on second-order observations of conceptions of world order and world society present in foreign policy discourse. Operative theories of world society and world order are not (only) found in the few corners IR has reserved for macrotheory, they are also found squarely in the middle of the foreign policy process. Finally, by way of conclusion, I will address the question of how such study of nested foreign policies contributes to other forms of theorizing global politics. On account of personal interest and expertise, German foreign policy will serve as a substantive anchor of this line of argument throughout the chapter.\\n\",\n",

Institutions constitute a critical factor for the creation of threshold effects in the impact of globalization on poverty. Institutions-their credibility, ability to be transformed by globalization, and the ways they give the poor access to the beneficial effects of globalization-determine whether the benefits of globalization are spread to the poor or are locked in by particular groups. They also determine whether or not the negative shocks associated with globalization are transmitted in an unfettered manner. The paper presents a theory of institutions that distinguishes several components, which evolve differently and explain the threshold effects that institutions generate upon the impact of globalization on the poor. The paper then shows that social institutions and norms have a critical role in the generation of these threshold effects. It finally examines the interactions between social institutions and state policies institutions, which may contribute to the formation of poverty traps.\\n',\n",

Yet, the variation in outcomes is still poorly understood. This article draws on state formation theory to elaborate a causal mechanism that can explain the successful monopolization of the means of violence in statebuilding interventions. Insights from the state formation literature suggest that the regional political system is crucial for state formation and statebuilding. In order to test the hypothesis, a novel process-tracing method is applied to the case of Sierra Leone. The case study suggests that only a cooperative regional setting enables interventions to succeed.\\n',\n",

Citation of such a paper should account for its provisional character. A revised version may be available directly from the author. In this article, we discuss and synthesize a rapidly growing body of research from which a new stylized fact has emerged: people exposed to war violence tend to behave more cooperatively after war. We show the range of cases where this holds true, and persists, even many years after war. We can do so because of a wealth of new data. Until recently, a paucity of individuallevel data from conflict and post-conflict societies prevented researchers from systematically exploring the legacies of war on social and political behavior. In the last decade, however, interdisciplinary teams of researchers -mainly in economics, anthropology, political science, and psychology -have begun to design research projects specifically to understand how exposure to war violence a...',\n",

A pesquisa centra-se na ascensão do partido Liberal-Unitário e na trama subsequente que trouxe diversas lideranças provinciais para a esfera centralizadora. A mobilização para o conflito contra o Paraguai acelerou o processo de unificação, ao subordinar as lideranças provinciais de forma mais consistente. Essa subordinação se deu através do recrutamento militar e da repressão às oligarquias dissidentes. Nesse sentido, a campanha contra o Paraguai constituiu tanto uma guerra externa como um complemento da longa guerra civil argentina.\\nPalavras-chave:Argentina, Unitários, Guerra do Paraguai, Nacionalização.Abstract: This article relates the conduct of the war against Paraguay to the process of state building in Argentina. The research focuses on the rise of the Liberal-Unitarian party and the subsequent plot that brought several provincial leaders into its centralizing sphere. Mobilization for the conflict against Paraguay accelerated the process of centralization, by subordinating provincial leaders more consistently. Such subordination was achieved through a combination of military recruitment and repression against dissident oligarchies. Thus, the campaign against Paraguay was simultaneously an international conflict and a continuation of the long Argentinean civil war.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstractSince 2011, elephant poaching and the illegal ivory trade have been labelled a \"serious threat to peace and security\". Rigorous military training and weapons have been provided to rangers, national armies have been deployed in protected areas, and shoot-to-kill policies have been (re-)adopted. Within the framework of political ecology, the article critically approaches this \"war\" for Africa\\'s elephants. Adopting the tools of discourse analysis, it explores how such violence has been legitimized by the \"transnational conservation community\" and, in turn, how this has been contested by other actors. It argues that the \"war\" has been legitimized by drawing on two broader threat discourses -the ivory-crime-terror linkage and the \\'ChinaAfrica\\' threat. Through the discursive creation of a boundary object, poaching has \\'become\\' a human concern that appeals to actors typically outside the conservation community. In the final Section, the case of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army\\'s poaching activities in Garamba National Park is explored, to show how the knowledge upon which judgements are made and decisions are taken is ahistorical, depoliticized and based on a series of untenable assumptions. Key words: Conservation, violence, discourse, ivory, political ecology\\nRésuméDepuis 2011, le braconnage des éléphants et le commerce illégal de l\\'ivoire sont qualifiés de « grave menace contre la paix et la sécurité des Etats ». Un entraînement militaire rigoureux et des armes ont été fournis aux gardes-parcs; les armées nationales ont été déployées dans certains parcs nationaux et une politique de \\'tirer pour tuer\\' a été (ré)adoptée. Partant d\\'une approche d\\'écologie politique, ce papier de recherche analyse d\\'une façon critique la « guerre » pour les éléphants africains. Adoptant les outils de l\\'analyse de discours, il examine comment une telle violence a été légitimée par la « communauté de la conservation » et, comment cette légitimation a été à son tour contestée par d\\'autres acteurs. Cette « guerre » a été légitimée en mobilisant deux discours se référant à des menaces diffuses -la connexion ivoire-crime-terreur, et la menace de la « Chine-Afrique ». Converti par le discours en un « objet-frontière », le braconnage a pris une dimension large, faisant appel à des acteurs en-dehors de la communauté de la conservation. Finalement, le cas des activités de braconnage du Lord\\'s Resistance Army dans le Parc national de Garamba, République Démocratique du Congo, est pris comme exemple pour montrer comment la connaissance sur laquelle des jugements sont posés et des décisions prises est ahistorique, dépolitisée et repose sur une série de présupposés intenables.

       "   'abstract': \"\\nThe rise in pirate attacks in the proximity of the Horn of Africa and particularly off the Somali coast contributed to increasing international concern over the issue of piracy. In this article, instead of localizing and de-historicizing piracy in the Gulf of Aden as a problem of 'state collapse' and 'insufficient international aid', I argue that both piracy and international responses to it must be read as part of a much longer history of conflict, by which market institutions and respect for private property have been globalized at the point of appearing today as Universal, natural and eternal. I show how, since the eighteenth century, European empires often posed as a necessary bastion of law and order in the oceans of the world, legitimizing their violence as a form of neutral policing against depoliticized native 'pirates'. Reducing the colonized Other to a 'pirate' lacking any political motive and/or legitimacy allowed European empires to depict imperialist wars as benign operations of international policing, and the colonization of entire communities as necessary for the civilization of the gangsters and criminals in their midst. In light of this history, I question the contemporary international mobilization against Somali piracy. In particular, I show how it risks banalizing and depoliticizing the complex issues that have contributed to the transformation of the sea in a zone of violence, in which different forms of plunder operate side by side.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nThe security sector reform literature is increasingly turning towards the inclusion of non-state security providers, but the long-term patterns of political development to which such engagement might contribute remain underexplored. This article thus provides several lenses with which to understand the relationship between non-state security provision and political development. It first presents three perspectives (functionalism, political economy, and communitarianism) with which to understand the nature and behavior of non-state security providers. Second, it outlines five possible long-term trajectories of political formation and the role of non-state security providers in each. These discussions highlight the idea of hybridity, and the remainder of the paper argues that the concept can be usefully applied in (at least) two ways. The third section proposes that hybridity can help overcome longstanding but misleading conceptual binaries, while the fourth rearticulates hybridity as a dynamic developmental process -hybridization -that can be contrasted with security politics as the underlying logic by which security providers (both state and non-state) interact and change over time.\\n',\n",

One outlier exists: Chiang Mai province\\'s remote southwestern district, Omkoi. 90% of the district is a national forest reserve where human habitation is illegal. However, an ethnic Karen population has lived there since long before the law that outlawed them was created, unconnected to the state by road, with limited or no access to health, education and other services: they cultivate the majority of Thailand\\'s known opium poppy, because they have little other choice. They increasingly rely on cash-based markets, their lack of citizenship precludes them from land tenure which might incentivize them to grow alternate crops, and their statelessness precludes them from services and protections. Nor is the Thai state the singular Leviathan that states are often assumed to be; it is a collection of networks with divergent interests, of whom one of the most powerful, the Royal Forestry Department, has purposely made Omkoi\\'s population illegible to the state, and has consistently blocked the attempts of other state actors to complexify this state space beyond the simplicity of its forest. These factors make short-term, high-yield, high value, imperishable opium the most logical economic choice for poor Karen farmers residing in this \"non-state\" space.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstract: Thailand\\'s near-total elimination of opium poppy cultivation is attributed to \"alternative development\" programming, which replaces illicit crops with licit ones. However, opium poppy cultivation was not drastically reduced because substitute crops earned the same income as opium: nothing can equal the price of opium to smallholder farmers, especially those without land tenure. Thailand\\'s reduction in poppy cultivation was achieved by the increased presence and surveillance capability of state security actors, who, year by year, were able to locate and destroy fields, and arrest cultivators, with increasing accuracy. This coercion was also accompanied by benefits to cultivators, including the provision of health and education services and the extension of roads; both stick and carrot constituted the encroachment of the Thai state. The provision of citizenship to hill tribe members also gave them a vested interest in the state, through their ability to hold land, access health care, education and work opportunities, amongst others. These initiatives did not occur without costs to hill tribe cultures for whom a symbiotic relationship with the land was and remains disrupted. These findings indicate that alternative development programming unlinked to broader state-building initiatives in Afghanistan, Myanmar and other opium poppy-producing areas will fail, because short-term, high-yield, high value, imperishable opium will remain the most logical choice for poor farmers, especially given the lack of a farmer\\'s vested interest in the state which compels them to reduce their income whilst offering them no other protections or services.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nABSTRACT\\nFocusing on a story of former firefighters who used a counterfeit rescue vehicle to perform a false emergency as a cover‐up for drug trafficking in the tri‐border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, this article engages the concept of camouflage to intervene in anthropological discussions on statecraft. The article explores how drug traffickers—but also gendarmes, prefects, and customs officers, who help smugglers by accepting bribes—use the camouflage of legitimate political authority to enable illicit transactions. In the tri‐border area, the notion of camouflage helps explain how the contraband and corruption that pervade border relationships are inseparable from formal enactments of political authority. Camouflage, thus, helps illuminate the aesthetic, pragmatic, and moral connections between statecraft and criminality, further enhancing our analytical purchase on how the law and its violation are symbiotically intertwined. I argue that this study of corruption on the border reveals that state effects are created by endless refractions, which do more than blur the distinction between law and crime, between the deceived and the deceiving, between the original and the counterfeit. Camouflage does not merely blend the predictable dichotomous categories by which we approach and analyze the performance of the state, but by obfuscating any clear distinction between the legal, the political, and the criminal, it actually enables states to happen.',\n",

While a portion of these resources does end up in private pockets, the article shows that a greater share of the resources are directed toward enhancing state performance: welfare programs, everyday police duties, and political activities.

Mientras que una porción de estos recursos termina ilegalmente en manos privadas, el artículo muestra que una gran porción de dichos recursos es utilizada para mejorar ciertas prestaciones estatales: programas sociales, tareas policiales de rutina y actividades políticas.

It argues that the locus of military knowledge production has moved from what can be described as 'forging knowledge' to 'deciphering knowledge'. This transition is linked to a crisis in the classic representation of war, which is based on the congruence between three binary signifiers: enemy, arena, and violence. The article asserts that the blurring of these three signifiers has created a Bourdieuian field of military knowledge production in which symbolic capital is obtained from the production of knowledge that deciphers the new uncertainty. The article follows the relations between the binaries and the types of knowledge that have been imported and translated in the IDF with regard to four major operational settings: the Oslo redeployment, the Second Intifada, the disengagement from Gaza, and the aftermath of the Second Lebanon War.\\n\",\n",

The country is the gift of three main rivers: the Ganges, Padma, and Brahmaputra/Jamuna, which combine before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Although floods submerge part of the country each year, Bangladesh experienced two truly devastating floods in 1987 and 1988, the latter hitting the country especially hard as the peaks of the three major rivers synchronized within a two-week period. The discharge of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna, the biggest of the three, averages 19,000 m 3 /s, but approached 100,000 m 3 /s in 1987/88. The 1988 flood, a one in a hundred year event, put 60 percent of the country under water for two weeks, damaging 7.2 million homes, affecting 45 million people and causing 2,300 immediate deaths (Wood 1999).Amid the many mishaps striking Bangladesh every year, this particular hazard reaching the top of the international agenda seems fortuitous.

       "   'abstract': '\\nWe report on recent findings of a fruitful research agenda that explores the importance of ethnic-specific traits in shaping African development. First, using recent surveys from Sub-Saharan African countries, we document that individuals identify with their ethnic group as often as with the nation pointing to the salience of ethnicity. Second, we focus on the various historical and contemporary functions of tribal leaders (chiefs) and illustrate their influence on various aspects of the economy and the polity. Third, we elaborate on a prominent dimension of ethnicity, that of the degree of complexity of pre-colonial political organization. Building on insights from the African historiography, we review recent works showing a strong association between pre-colonial centralization and contemporary comparative development both across and within countries. We also document that the link between pre-colonial political centralization and regional development -as captured by satellite images of light density at night-is particularly strong in areas outside the vicinity of the capitals, where due to population mixing and the salience of national institutions ethnic traits play a lesser role. Overall, our evidence is supportive to theories and narratives on the presence of a “dual” economic and institutional environment in Africa.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nAbstractWhere do associations come from? One answer is that they are constructed by individuals with high levels of resources and skills. Another answer is that associations crystallize around a scaffolding of resources, opportunities, and cultural models rooted in the state and world society. We argue the expansion and 'openness' of state institutions encourage the formation of associations. Moreover, the institutional structures of world society provide resources and legitimation, supporting the formation of domestic association around the globe. Longitudinal cross-national data on voluntary associations are analyzed using panel models with fixed effects to address unobserved heterogeneity and instrumental variables models to address possible endogeneity. Wealthy and highly educated societies have more associations, consistent with classic views. Institutional features of the state, including overall expansion and openness (i.e., democracy, decentralization) are also linked to higher levels of association. And, nations more strongly tied to world society and those receiving international resources devoted to civil society have more associations. Also, the expanding structure of world society is correlated with growth of association over time. Finally, the impact of these factors varies across types of association. Democracy, for instance, encourages political association but not recreational groups. National ties to world society most strongly affect associations whose aims tend to mirror the agendas of the international community.These factors help make sense of the distinctive configurations of civil society found around the globe.3\\n\",\n",

The concentration of power at the local level is so strong, that even the core institutions of the state are under control of local interests. Thus, in Kandahar province powerful tribal individuals control the means of violence. The combination of insurgency, drug networks and tribal structures has encouraged the emergence of strong warlords and the Taliban in Kandahar. In contrast to Kandahar, Kunduz province shows myriads of minifiefdoms as well as localized 'rules of law', or 'rules of the gun', which result in fragmented warlordism. Finally, in Paktia province tribal identities are the most important points of reference. The Pashtun tribal code of law and behavior is the 'rule of the game', and Paktia tribes settle their conflicts in tribal gatherings by discussion until a consensus is reached.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nAbstractRacketeering local activities, though less relevant in terms of financial turnover, still represents a distinctive feature of mafia-like organisations for it provides them with striking social power. Mafias constitute indeed forms of governance that heavily rely on the acquiescence, if not on the consensus, of the community which they are rooted in. I thus argue that territoriality is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the mafia phenomenon: territories contribute to the reproduction of mafia groups not only in ecological terms, providing human and economic resources to organised crime, but also in cultural ones, forming symbolic and representational spaces that play an active role in the socialisation of the norms at the bottom of people's compliance. The production of space in areas policed by mafia groups is the dynamics that I sought to account for by undertaking field research in the surroundings of Caserta, also known as Gomorrah, where the clout of the Camorra (the Neapolitan mafia) is notorious and yet to be tarnished. I focused on non-compliant spatial practices for illuminating, by contrast, how space takes part to the construction of the mafia governance: the findings presented in this paper come from participant observation and in-depth interviews conducted in former properties of the Camorra where two worker cooperatives installed themselves and started legal businesses in outright contrast with organised crime. This process of reterritorialisation, I argue, discloses the sociological intersection between space and mafia, raising relevant policy implications about the fight against such form of organised crime.2\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstract\\nThe project of ensuring that political settlements are inclusive is key to attempts to navigate transitions from conflict over the last quarter of a century or so. Examining such transitions, we point to the emergence of the ‘formalised political unsettlement’ as a persistent outcome. The formalised political unsettlement translates the disagreement at the heart of the conflict into a set of political and legal institutions for continuing negotiation. As the conditions of its emergence are unlikely to change and the formalised political unsettlement may be here to stay, we point to the opportunities for navigating between elite inclusion and broader societal inclusion that it offers.

It introduces a new concept of 'peace formation', which counterbalances a reliance on internal violent or externalised institutions' agency, reform and conditionality. Without incorporating a better understanding of the multiple and often critical agencies involved in peace formation, the states emerging from statebuilding will remain as they are: failed by design. This is because they are founded on externalised systems, legitimacy and norms rather than a contextual, critical and emancipatory epistemology of peace. Engaging with the processes of peace formation may aid international actors in gaining a better understanding of the roots of a conflict, how local actors may be assisted, how violence and power-seeking may be ended or managed and how local legitimacy may emerge.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'A growing literature on the subnational diffusion of armed conflict rests on the proposition that political violence triggers more violence, in the same locality and elsewhere. Yet state efforts to contain such uprisings remain largely unexplored, theoretically and empirically. Drawing on a mathematical model of epidemics, we formalize the logic of conflict diffusion and derive conditions under which state coercion might limit the spread of insurgent violence. Using a new dataset of insurgent and government violence in Russia’s North Caucasus from 2000 to 2008, we evaluate the relative effectiveness of four coercive strategies: (1) denial, which manipulates the costs of expanding insurgent activity to new locations, (2) punishment, which manipulates the costs of sustained fighting in contested areas, (3) denial and punishment, which does both, and (4) no action, which does neither. We find denial to be most effective at containing insurgent violence. Punishment is least effective, and even counterproductive. Not only does such a strategy fail to prevent the spillover of violence to new locations, but it may amplify the risk of continued fighting in contested areas. In the Caucasus, denial is found to be the least inflammatory counter-insurgency option for Russia. For it to succeed, Russia should physically isolate centers of insurgent activity from regions of nonviolence and avoid the temptation of punitive reprisals.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nAbstractAn original data set of wars from 1648 to the present indicates that security and material interest are rarely the principal motives for war for rising, great or dominant powers. These states far more often go to war for reasons of standing. The empirical evidence offers no support for power transition, balance of power, Marxist or rationalist theories of war. The frequency of war between and among rising, great and dominant powers is likely to decline precipitously because the most important motives for war in the past -standing, security, revenge, material interests and domestic politics -are, for the most part, no longer served effectively by war. Changes in ideas, not changes in material conditions, are primarily responsible for this transformation.\\nKeywords: ideas, material interests, revenge, security, standing, warThe origins of interstate war are of central importance to policymakers and students of international relations alike. Drawing on my theory of international relations I offer a novel approach to this problem that stresses the determining role of human motives and the ways in which those motives reflect deeper cultural orientations. Culture evolves and influences the hierarchy of motives. Culture also channels motives, encouraging and rewarding some kinds of behavior and discouraging others. By approaching war in terms of culture and motives, we can get a better handle on the causes of war in the modern state system and a better understanding of the extent to which it has a future.A Cultural Theory of International Relations develops a theory of international relations based on three universal human motives -appetite, spirit (thumos) and reason -and a powerful emotion -fear -which arises when reason loses control over appetite or spirit. It addresses these motives primarily because they are the most relevant to foreign policy and effectively capture most of the variance. 1 Spirit aside, these concepts are well known to students of international relations. The spirit refers to the universal human drive for self-esteem. By excelling at activities valued by society we win the approbation of those who matter and so feel good about ourselves. Institutions and states have neither psyche nor emotions. However, the people who comprise and run them do. They often project their psychological needs on to their political units, and feel better about themselves when those units win victories or perform well. In classical Greece the polis was the center of political life and a citizen's status was usually a reflection of that of his polis. Something similar happens in the modern world, where the state has replaced the polis as the unit of transference.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This paper seeks to understand the relationship between state building, interstate and intrastate rivalry. Previous studies of state building have focused primarily on the European experience, with selective application to cases in the developing world. Prior studies of interstate rivalry have focused primarily on their effects on interstate relations. This paper seeks to expand the domain of both literatures. First, the paper investigates the applicability of the predatory theory of the state, derived from the European experience, in the context of the postcolonial developing world. Second, the paper expands interstate rivalry research to an examination of the effects of both interstate and intrastate rivals on domestic politics. In particular, the literature derived from the European experience considers decisions about fiscal policy as central to the process of state building and survival. Therefore, this paper examines the effects of internal and external rivals on extractive capacity in the context of state development in sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Asia from 1975 to 2000. A series of pooled, cross‐sectional time‐series analyses suggest that external and internal rivals increase the extractive capacity of the state in a manner similar to the experience of early modern Europe.',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nThe European state-building experience has led many scholars to argue that war forces states to increase their fiscal-administrative capacity, or what we might refer to as political development, in order to compete in the international system. War also requires states to generate wealth to support such competition, which should lead to progressively increased levels of economic development. Yet, in contemporary empirical studies, war is often studied as a dependent variable, with economic and political development modeled as affecting its origination. This reading of theory and empirical work suggests that war, economic development, and political development constitute an endogenous system. In this paper, we develop expectations about how these three processes interact and test them using a three-stage least squares regression model. The results show significant simultaneous relationships between the three processes. We conclude that war, economic development, and political development are mutually constitutive processes in the contemporary international system. What is the relationship between war, political development, and economic development? Given the fundamental role these processes have played in the development of the international system and the domestic societies of the states that comprise this system, one might expect that scholars have developed a coherent body of theory and related battery of empirical tests to answer this question. There are certainly islands of theory and scattered empirical tests, but nothing comprehensive to date. We do our best in this paper to knit together existing theory under a broadly construed predatory theory approach to the state.This approach suggests that the capacity of states to aggregate, collect, and consume the resources of society has generally increased across time.

This study investigates de facto states’ internal legitimacy—people's confidence in the entity itself, the regime, and institutions. While internal legitimacy is important for any state, it is particularly important for de facto states, whose lack of external legitimacy has made internal legitimacy integral to their quest for recognition. We propose that the internal legitimacy of de facto states depends on how convincing they are to their “citizens” as state‐builders. Using original data from a 2010 survey in Abkhazia, we examine this argument based on respondent perceptions of security, welfare, and democracy. Our findings suggest that internal legitimacy is shaped by the key Weberian state‐building function of monopoly of the legitimate use of force, as well as these entities’ ability to fulfill other aspects of the social contract.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Due to its systemic approach, structural realism (or neorealism) can be subsumed under methodological holism, which takes social phenomena to be wholes that cannot be reduced to their parts. The wholes posited by structural realism are the state and the international structure. Recent developments in the philosophy of social science suggest that methodological holism ought to be limited to causal explanation and complemented by ontological individualism, which requires an account of how social wholes derive from individuals. Structural realism lacks such an account because it takes the state as an empirical given, mistaking for a fact what is really a concept in need of deductive derivation from individuals. To bring the theory methodologically up to date, this essay undertakes such a derivation of the state from individuals, proceeding in the deductive manner of political theory. It thus provides structural realism with a methodologically valid ontology, which, in turn, enables the theory to better defend itself against liberal and constructivist critics who reduce the state to a transient phenomenon.',\n",

       "   'abstract': ' This article identifies and analyses the tactic of kidnapping migrants that is increasingly deployed by states to disrupt, decelerate, and block migrants’ mobility. Kidnapping, we argue, is one of the political technologies of capture used by state authorities in their efforts to reassert control over migratory movements. This analysis contributes to a new understanding of the politics of border enforcement through strategies aimed at the containment of migration. The article focuses on the U.S.–Mexico border and the European border in the Mediterranean Sea as crucial sites where states have increasingly engaged in heterogenous modes of kidnapping.It also considers migrant struggles against these diverse kidnapping tactics. Through a focus on kidnapping, the article expands how we understand border violence and interrogates accounts of the biopolitics and necropolitics of borders that rely on the overly reductive formula of ‘making live/letting die’. The article concludes by highlighting how the critical examination of kidnapping migrants allows us to trace affinities and partial continuities among various historical modes of racialised subjugation that have affected both contemporary migrants and previously colonised populations.

The central element is the question whether threats of violence as well as the actual performance of violence by non-state actors serve the 'general good' that the state, and therefore these non-state actors appropriating its authority, stand to protect or rather the particular interests of those in charge of the organizations. The article considers the tainted history of ormas as militias affiliated to the New Order regime and involved in crime in seeking to come to terms with the present claim of regional ormas to being lawful and patriotic defenders of regional interests against predatory national elites. Using heuristic analyses of ormas activities, the article considers discourses of ormas legitimacy in the light of the appropriation of sovereign violent practices as manifestations of democracy.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nPolitical parties do not merely reflect social divisions, they actively construct them. While this point has been alluded to in the literature, surprisingly little attempt has been made to systematically elaborate the relationship between parties and the social, which tend to be treated as separate domains contained by the disciplinary division of labor between political science and sociology. This article demonstrates the constructive role of parties in forging critical social blocs in three separate cases, India, Turkey, and the United States, offering a critique of the dominant approach to party politics that tends to underplay the autonomous role of parties in explaining the preferences, social cleavages, or epochal socioeconomic transformations of a given community. Our thesis, drawing on the work of Gramsci, Althusser, and Laclau, is that parties perform crucial articulating functions in the creation and reproduction of social cleavages. Our comparative analysis of the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States, Islamic and secularist parties in Turkey, and the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress parties in India will demonstrate how \"political articulation\" has naturalized class, ethnic, religious, and racial formations as a basis of social division and hegemony. Our conclusion is that the process of articulation must be brought to the center of political sociology, simultaneously encompassing the study of social movements and structural change, which have constituted the orienting poles of the discipline.This article examines three contemporary political projects: white racial formation and suburbanization in the United States, Islamic mobilization in Turkey, and Hindu nationalism in India. The outcome in each case has been a racialized or ethnoreligious bloc. Our research question attempts to illuminate the decisive processes that are common to all three cases. To that end we ask simply: Why these particular social formations and not others?Despite the fact that each of these projects is often identified with a specific political party-the Republican Party in the United States, the Justice and Development Party in Turkey, and the Bharatiya Janata Party in India-much of the literature fails to systematically elaborate the role of parties in the construction of these * Address correspondence to: Cihan Tugal,\\n',\n",

The primary point of comparison between Iran and Turkey is smoking-attributable annual productivity loses of each country as estimated through the use of smoking-attributable mortality, morbidity and economic costs software (SAMMEC) and the available related literature. Based on the calculations derived from the SAMMEC model, Iran is burdened with an incredible cost to the economy borne by a high prevalence of smokers.Conclusions:It is concluded that an awareness of this condition enables OFAC to award licenses to big tobacco without fear of undermining current foreign policy initiatives.\",\n",

This article argues that the major source of differences in 'tax effort' is the colonial histories of various countries. Using standard measures of 'tax effort in a panel data framework and dividing colonial Africa along forms of incorporation into the colonial system, it shows that African countries and others with similar colonial histories have higher levels of 'tax effort'. However, the difference disappears when we control for the colonial factor. These results hold under different model specifications.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': ' Most welfare state typologies still characterize Switzerland as a liberal welfare regime. However, recent research shows that its welfare state did not retrench but instead moved towards the conservative type. Nevertheless, higher social expenditure has not been accompanied by increases in taxation. Moreover, Switzerland managed to overcome the so-called trilemma of the service economy. After analyzing the shift of the Swiss welfare state from a liberal to a conservative welfare regime, we argue that the Swiss economic success story of the twentieth century is based on a favourable policy mix (tax system, labour market, financial sector) used to compete successfully in the world market for protection. We conclude that, as a political entrepreneur, Switzerland has the capability to receive taxes and investments from foreign individuals and enterprises, wealthy residents and high-skilled and well-paid immigrants to finance the welfare state and to overcome the trilemma of the service economy.

The ratio of civilian to military casualties is claimed to have tilted, so that the overwhelming majority of those killed today are civilians. Using systematic data that are comparable across cases and over time we find that, contrary to the 'new wars' thesis, the human impact of civil conflict is considerably lower in the post-Cold War period. We argue this pattern reflects the decline of ideological conflict, the restraining influence of globalization on governments, and the increasing rarity of superpower campaigns of destabilization and counterinsurgency through proxy warfare.Word Count: 11 986\\n\",\n",

As a consequence, criminological theories should be introduced into theoretical discussions about the nature of the contemporary global scene. Such interdisciplinary cross‐fertilization is vital, given the centrality of the language of criminal threats in the language of global governance and the language of governance globally.\\n',\n",

It has been argued that including the costs of appropriation and violent enforcement in transaction costs is based on the assumption that Coaseian bargaining can be extended to any institutional scenario, i.e., voluntary as well as coercive exchange. However, voluntary transactions cannot capture the logic of coercive power. This means that the assumption of an efficient political market is not valid, and that the \"Political Coase Theorem\" lacks the logical consistency to provide a cornerstone for political theory.\\n',\n",

This essay reviews the bellicist literature and offers an explanation for variation in state capacity among the most war‐prone states in the developing world. We investigate the influence of war on state strength in two countries, Afghanistan and Vietnam. We examine three hypothesized causal mechanisms about how war contributes to state formation: raising money, building armies, and making nations. We find that war in Vietnam contributed to state‐building, while war in Afghanistan has been state‐destroying. There appear to be two main factors that contributed to state‐making in Vietnam that were absent in Afghanistan: the existence of a core ethnic group that had served as the basis for a relatively long‐standing political community in the past, and the combination of war and revolution, which inspired state officials and facilitated the promulgation of a unifying national ideology. Of these two factors, comparative data suggest relative ethnic homogeneity is the most important. Absent these specific conditions, war is more likely to break than make states in the contemporary Third World.\\n',\n",

In this paper, I review five different accountability relationships that exist in foreign aid projects among donors, governments, implementing agencies and end users. Then I summarize existing empirical evidence demonstrating that foreign aid functions better—both at the macro‐level of aid flows and at the micro‐level of individual aid projects—when there is more government and implementing agency accountability. Specifying several mechanisms that facilitate accountability, I emphasize that participation is a tool often used to produce accountability within aid projects. However, in terms of donor accountability to aid‐receiving countries and the end users in them, recent pushes for increased participation have not resulted in more accountability in the design of aid programs. Ultimately, although enthusiasm for participatory models of aid design and delivery is warranted, participation is not a panacea for all the accountability problems in foreign aid programs.\\n',\n",

International Studies Review, doi: 10.1111/j.1468‐2486.2012.01102.x\\nSince the early 1990s, the large‐N civil war research program has been a vibrant one but has reached an analytical plateau because methodological issues have obscured fundamental conceptual and theoretical concerns. The existing ground‐clearing work has shed light on macro‐ and micro‐level determinants of internal conflict onset, duration, and termination, but has left the field theoretically impoverished. This article discusses remaining gaps in the quantitative civil war literature, and proposes conceptual, theoretical, and methodological remedies. Five main lacunae are identified. First, civil war may be a longer process, with several waves of escalation and de‐escalation, than generally described in the extant literature. Second, existing theories conflate civil conflict with violence—war onset and violence may be conceptually distinct. Third, we have few systemic‐level theories of civil war onset and duration. Fourth, we need better theories that allow us to determine whether civil wars are different from other types of wars. Finally, we need to go beyond state‐centric monadic approaches, and be more rigorous when building our models for explaining civil war onset, duration, or termination.',\n",

Mounting such an argument means meeting the charge of those who see the broader construction of strategic studies as vague and meaningless, and as detracting from the ability to make good policy. The article attempts, therefore, to map human security in as inclusive and systematic a way as possible. It attempts to show that the concept is neither vague nor meaningless, and is suitable, therefore, to be the basis for a comprehensive account of global security.How should global security be conceptualised? For example, should our focus remain restricted to the familiar politico-strategic (interstate/militarist/diplomatic) approaches to the subject? Or should it be broadened to incorporate more cooperative and collective, comprehensive and ultimately human concerns?\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nAbstractTwenty years after its horrific genocide, Rwanda has become a model for economic development. At the same time, its government has been criticized for its authoritarian tactics and use of violence. Missing from the often-polarized debate are the connections between these two perspectives. Synthesizing existing literature on Rwanda in light of a combined year of fieldwork, we argue that the GoR is using the developmental infrastructure to deepen state power and expand political control. We first identify the historical pressures that have motivated the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) to re-imagine the political landscape. Sectarian unrest, political rivalry, wider regional insecurity, and aid withdrawal have all pressured the RPF to identify growth as strategic. However, the country's political transformation extends beyond a prioritisation of growth and encompasses the reordering of the social and physical layout of the territory, the articulation of new ideologies and mindsets, and the provision of social services and surveillance infrastructure. Growth and social control go hand in hand. As such, the paper's main contribution is to bring together the two sides of the Rwandan debate and place the country in a broader sociological literature about the parallel development of capitalist relations and transformations in state power.\\nAcknowledgements:The authors are grateful to\\n\",\n",

In der funktional differenzierten Gesellschaft wird der sozialstrukturelle Ort von Krieg und Kriegstruppen enger zugeschnitten, stärker ausdifferenziert und stärker funktional spezifiziert als in vormodernen Gesellschaften. Die Rekrutierungsbasis für Kämpfer kann, im Einklang mit dem allgemeinen Inklusionstrend der Moderne, mit dieser Umstellung gleichwohl breiter werden. In der Folge ergeben sich typische Probleme der Rollenkombination und -kompatibilisierung. Summary: Many features of recent wars can be understood along the lines of a theory of society and institutional differentiation. Armed conflicts and armed forces partake in the trend toward the more pronounced structural differentiation and functional specification observable in various institutional domains, here most relevantly in the domain of politics. Notwithstanding the delimited structural location of wars, war personnel can be recruited from an entire populace according to the universalistic principles of modern society; but soldiers and other combatants will often hold roles in further institutional contexts as well, which gives rise to typical problems of the multiple inclusion and mutual (in)compatibility of roles. Irregular combatants can be seen to pursue an autonomous, non-governmental, \"grassroots\" inclusion in war. Last but not least, the issues of civilian casualties and the wide-spread public aversion to war can be interpreted according to the double theorem of inclusion and institutional differentiation.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstract\\nIn contrast to the common tendency to see war as the result of leadership decisions based on risk assessments, and political and economic considerations about gains or losses, we use a constructivist and institutional perspective to historicize and politicize the way “nation‐state interests” and “nation‐state preferences” even in a decision to go to war are socially constructed and culturally embedded. We maintain that with the end of the Cold War, many societies found themselves at a crossroads where they had to resolve internal conflicts in regards to neoliberal globalization. These internal conflicts and a crisis of identity, between those who supported the principle of globalization and regarded it as a promise for democracy, openness, liberty and peace, and those who saw it as a danger to their exceptionality and distinctiveness, ended in wars (either internal wars or external wars) when the objectors of neoliberal globalization succeeded in creating an institutional turn which presented war as the “efficient,” “necessary,” “legitimate”, or “desired” solution to the new threatening reality.\\nWe demonstrate the validity of this argument by using Israel as a test case, examining how institutional changes in the 1990s, arising from internal societal conflicts around the Oslo Agreements, led the state to move from the brink of peace to new wars despite exogenous objections to its policy.\\n',\n",

Our framework delineates the strategic behaviour patterns of each of the tripartite IR actors under collective bargaining. It maintains that the initial period of the collective bargaining era constituted a critical juncture for state labour policy that occurred in distinctive ways in different countries and that these differences played a central role in shaping the different union structures in the following decades. Our historical analysis shows that unlike its Western counterparts, the Japanese state was able to eradicate the horizontal union movement at the onset of the collective bargaining era because of its advantages as a late developer and Cold War politics, which resulted in enterprise unionism in Japan.

       "   'abstract': \"In an era of increasingly well‐attended and violent protests around the world against globalisation, this commentary seeks to answer the crucial question: The globalisation of what? The answer proposed is that what is globalising is ‘Industria’, a multiplicitous, global system of power/knowledge, a vast ‘machinic assemblage’ recently accreted from diverse, competing world systems. After describing some of the most serious challenges facing human communities and the rest of the biosphere, the commentary enlists the aid of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze and his colleague Félix Guattari to expose the cognitive errors underlying political and environmental problems. Applying Deleuze's philosophy of difference to geopolitics and resource‐use management, it is shown that representational epistemologies and a negative ontology of identity obscure the myriad interconnections among human and non‐human beings, leading to conflict and ecological degradation. From there, the ‘Industria’ hypothesis is presented as a conceptual response to Deleuze and Guattari's critique of the ‘Urstaat’ and as a framework for scholars grappling with the need to achieve socioeconomic and ecological sustainability. Finally, the commentary briefly explores the potential of a differential, bioregional geopolitics as a civilised alternative to the predations of Industria.\",\n",

It is divided into two halves: a review of literature and research, and a cross-national data analysis. The first half reviews literature on the emergence of tax and revenue systems in the West and on the relevance of these frameworks and findings to developing countries. The second half uses cluster analysis to identify groups of developing countries with contrasting revenue systems in 2000, and then compares these with our previous analysis of welfare regimes in the Global South. We conclude that higher tax or revenue levels are not associated with more advanced or effective welfare systems. It is only the scope of social security contributions that correlates with protowelfare states in the developing world.\\n',\n",

However, there are further considerations in violent contexts, where refusal of bribes may have dire consequences. Yet, insight into this topic is limited. This article investigates how violence upholds bribery, through interviews with South African officials who enforce regulations in communities where gangs operate. The investigation shows that when citizens offer bribes to enable rule violations, this is a process of both temptation and threats: officials who refuse bribes face intimidation by both citizens and colluding colleagues. This illustrates how violence may function as a mechanism to enforce corrupt contracts between bureaucrats and criminal citizens. Through reducing costs in such settings, bribe‐taking is partly a strategy of social protection. This has implications for policy and suggests that, besides incentives and expectations, administrative reforms may benefit from ‘fixing the security’ of bureaucrats in violent contexts.\\n\",\n",

Such stationary and monopolist bandits would effectively transform themselves into autocratic rulers of pristine states. I argue that Olson's ideas do not constitute a satisfactory theory of state‐formation for two main reasons. First, kleptocracy, which is a condition of competitive theft, represents an equilibrium according to Olson. So there exists no reason to believe that theft will become monopolised. Second, in Olson's theory, if a monopolist bandit exists, then a monopolist on violence presumably also exists. So having a ‘monopolist on violence’ seems to constitute both ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ in his account. However, if properly revised, his basic insights might nevertheless furnish an important hypothesis from which a more satisfactory theory of state‐formation could be constructed.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nThis article examines the relationship between welfare and state governance in Iran since the 1979Revolution. It argues that the contemporary set of social welfare organizations in Iran arose as a corollary to post-revolutionary state formation, particularly during the 1980-8 war with Iraq. The Revolution itself resulted in a process of 'dual institutionalization' where new revolutionary organizations appeared in tandem with the inherited bureaucracies of the Pahlavi Monarchy, and both sets of institutions were directed by the new regime towards social welfare in areas relatively untouched by the ancien régime. These institutions were locked in place by the exigencies of the long war that followed, and most have continued to the present. This is followed by a discussion of the main developmental outcomes of the past three decades in Iran in literacy, health and poverty. The article concludes by discussing how the successes and shortcomings of the Islamic Republic's welfare system are consequential for understanding broader developments in Iran today.\\n\",\n",

This in turn contributed to reconstitute the state as an abstract notion that nevertheless was real through the allegiance owed to it by its subjects. Addressing the making of subjecthood in relation to state formation helps fill an important lacuna in the literature on state formation, namely the double oversight of subjecthood. Either studies of state formation have taken both territory and subjecthood-the two objects of state power-for granted, or, more recently, they have assumed that changes in subjecthood were a function of changes in territoriality. I propose to address this by inquiring into early modern subjecthood in its own right, through a historical exploration of the emergence of political subjecthood in English statutes during the Tudor period . Through gradual yet incremental changes in the relation between subject/ king and subject/state, the political subject's allegiance to the state changed and acquired a Btaken-for-grantedness^-maintained and reinforced through constant legal reiteration.Keywords State formation .

In fact, states emerging from the long sixteenth century in command of both territory and subjects seem to acquire these in an unproblematic fashion. The focus of extant theories is largely on the emergence of a state apparatus, a bureaucracy, and a capacity to extract taxes and wage war, at the expense of explorations of the formation of the ties between state and subjects-the politicization of subjects, so to speak, or subjectification.To be sure, until recently this was the case with territory as well, until it was pointed out that the state formation literature was entrapped in its notions of territoriality-taking them for granted and not exploring their historical emergence.

       "   'abstract': '\\nIntroductionThe character of the Indian state has changed remarkably as a result of the economic reforms that were initiated in the early 1990s. This has been described as an \"elite revolt\" against the constraints of the dirigiste state by an alliance of business groups and the urban middle classes. 1 At the same time Maoist insurgents have expanded the areas in which they operate and increased the intensity of their operations, particularly in central and eastern states such as Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Orissa. 2 In recent years, representatives of the Indian state have made remarkable claims about the strength of the insurgents: former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described the insurgency as \"the single biggest internal-security challenge ever faced by our country\"; 3 according to P. Chidambaram, the erstwhile Union Minister of Home Affairs, the insurgents are \"active\" in 223 of India\\'s 626 districts; 4 and his ministry claimed that the insurgents \"call the shots\" in 40,000 square kilometers of Indian territory-an area the size of Switzerland. 5 While such statements are very effective at grabbing the attention of interested observers, they leave many unanswered questions. Lay terms such as insurgent activity and calling the shots are used as if it is clear what they mean when, in fact, it is not. Such phrases are, as Durkheim puts it, \"a tangle of vague impressions, prejudices, and emotions.\" 6 This article combines a variety of concepts from political sociology with evidence from newspaper reports, 7 insurgent and state documents, and ethnographic studies in order to analyze the nature of Maoist activities. There are two sections. The first aims to move beyond the prevailing Manichean understanding of the Maoist insurgency in India, which either portrays the insurgents as either gangsters or Gandhians. We show that both insurgent violence and fundraising serve, on the whole, the collective interests of the state building enterprise-that is, to consolidate insurgent control in their base areas-rather than the private interests of individual insurgents. The second section seeks to understand the interaction between the Maoist state builders and the Indian state. It argues that the insurgents undermine and fragment the state\\'s monopoly of the means of violence and administration in areas where they operate: in some areas the Indian state is totally absent, while in others the state forms alliances with the insurgents in order to maintain the semblance of a sovereign and democratic ruler.\\n',\n",

(Prison J 71(2): 3-14, 1991)  created to describe the development of inmate solidarity groups into prison gangs in the Texas Department of Corrections. Interviews with current and former prison gang members in Texas, Arizona, and Illinois augment the current published literature on prison gangs in California. This article argues that the responses which prison administrations make to prisoners' social orders are not static and have, in some cases, caused vertically configured groups to evolve into horizontally configured groups. These structural changes in prison gangs affect the gangs' ability to affect control in the criminal underworld outside prison. Accordingly, although the challenges which prison administrations present to vertically developed social orders within prison may improve the administrations' control within the prison walls, they may effectively decrease criminal-led social control on the street, leading to an increase in street-level violence.\\n\",\n",

The model of explanation is inspired by Charles Tilly's description of state making as organized crime, in which armed rebels and private economic agents enter an agreement for private protection. The study seeks to explain how an original meeting between Butembo's armed rebels of the\\u2002Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie — Mouvement de Libération (RCD–ML) and an existing network of cross‐border traders actually led to a ‘pluralizing’ moment, in which the reinterpretation of existing relations and regulatory practices contributed to a gradual transformation of the institutional framework and local governance. Recently, this local political order has entered into increasing competition with the internationally induced project of political ‘transition’, based on a conflict between dynamics of state building and translocal political (trans)formation.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nABSTRACT\\nTreating the ‘state’ as a finished product gets in the way of understanding it. The state is always in the making. This article, which acts as the Introduction to a special issue, argues that political authority is (re‐)produced through the process of successfully defining and enforcing rights to community membership and rights of access to important resources. Claims to rights prompt the exercise of authority. Struggles over property and citizenship are therefore as much about the scope and constitution of political authority as they are about access to resources and membership of a political community. The ability to entitle and disenfranchise people with regard to property, and to establish the conditions under which they hold property — together with the ability to define who belongs and who does not, and to establish and uphold rank, privilege and social servitude in its many forms — is constitutive of state power. Thus this essay argues that various moments of rupture (following periods of conflict, of colonial domination, of socialist, liberal, or authoritarian regimes, et cetera) allow us to see that rights do not simply flow from authority but also constitute it. Authority and rights are conceptually tied together by recognition. This article demonstrates how contracts of recognition unfold. It proposes an approach to the systematic investigation of the constitution of authority through the social production of property and citizenship as the recognition of claims to resources and membership. It thereby develops a way to study concrete dynamics of authority or state formation.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nABSTRACT\\nAlthough the Naxalite (Maoist) influence in India stretches from the north of Bihar to the south of Andhra Pradesh, their impact on the political economy of the Indian countryside — and specifically the tribal livelihood economy — remains understudied. This article examines how resource access is mediated in areas where both the state and the Naxalites hold some degree of public authority, using as a case study the trade in tendu leaves, used to make beedi cigarettes. This low‐profile, lootable resource provides the single most important source of income both for the tribals in North Telangana (during the summer season), and for the Maoists. The article presents a commodity chain framework, adapted to the concerns of multiple public authorities, to throw light on the linkages both between tribal procurement and Naxalite taxation and between government and Naxalite authority. The author argues that in a situation of long‐term conflict, relatively stable joint extraction regimes can be organized, by which all parties can benefit from multiple authority over certain resources.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nABSTRACT\\nIn this article, I explore the recent revalorization of non‐state forms of order and authority in the context of hybrid approaches to governance and state building in Africa. I argue for a more empirical and comparative approach to hybrid governance that is capable of distinguishing between constructive and corrosive forms of non‐state order, and sharpens rather than blurs the relationship between formal and informal regulation. A critique of the theoretical and methodological issues surrounding hybrid governance perspectives sets the scene for a comparative analysis of two contrasting situations of hybrid security systems: the RCD‐ML of eastern DR Congo, and the Bakassi Boys vigilante group of eastern Nigeria. In each case, four issues are examined: the basis of claims that regulatory authority has shifted to informal security systems; the local legitimacy of the security forces involved; the wider political context; and finally, whether a genuine transformation of regulatory authority has resulted, offering local populations a preferable alternative to the prior situation of neglectful or predatory rule. I argue that hybrid governance perspectives often essentialize informal regulatory systems, disguising coercion and political capture as popular legitimacy, and I echo calls for a more historically and empirically informed analysis of hybrid governance contexts.\\n',\n",

However, a market democracy is the outcome of specific historical and geo‐graphical circumstances, and cannot be replicated easily. This article explores four models of state formation: the Western, developmental, rentier and predatory state. Afghanistan can be characterized as a weak rentier state, subsisting on aid. Generally, the structural consequences of such aid rentierism are underestimated. ‘State building’ in this context cannot be successful. More aid ‘ownership’ and a strengthening of the Afghan bureaucracy will simply consolidate aid rentierism rather than reverse‐engineer a market democracy. A greater focus on economic policy is required to direct Afghanistan's rulers towards a more viable path of state formation. In this regard, the ‘developmental state’ offers some insights.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nABSTRACT\\nThe transformation of statehood in the rebel‐held northern half of Côte d’Ivoire builds on the reconfiguration of the social and political order. Though the state as an institution has almost ceased to exist, statehood as the practices that refer to it persists. This article examines the negotiations between the different non‐state actors and how these interactions shape, through everyday practices, the understanding of what a state should and should not do. The widely used saying of ‘Now one knows who is who’ answers the older expression that one does not know who is who. Before the crisis broke out in 2002, it was often difficult to distinguish between security providers and criminals. At that time, the police and gendarmerie could be either, while, through the rebellion, role ascriptions became clear and distinct. This article argues that the normative expectations of statehood are thus embedded in the general reconfiguration of society that has led to more stability and reliability of social roles.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstract\\nIn 2014, police responses to protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, prompted an unprecedented level of news coverage on the phenomenon of police militarization. Though the increased attention to police militarization and governmental programs thought to facilitate it (e.g., the 1033 Program) may give the impression that police militarization is a recent phenomena, social scientists have been documenting trends in police militarization for decades. This article provides an overview of the social science research literature on police militarization, starting with a discussion of a theory informed conceptualization of police militarization. We next discuss the major normative debates that have guided research on police militarization. We then review the empirical literature that focuses on the methodological approaches and findings of extant work on police militarization. Finally, we close with an overview of the state of the literature and suggestions for future research. Our major suggestion for future work is to consider the dimensions of police work that police militarization can occur in while continuing to engage with the normative debates of previous scholars so as to improve the overall quality of police work and public safety in the United States.\\n',\n",

Interviews were conducted with a sample of 42 current and former offenders with a history of group offending in an attempt to understand variation in the onset, maintenance, and cessation of OC careers. Offending narratives revealed different OC trajectories. Drug dealing was the primary modus operandi of OC groups, but some offenders exhibited versatility and progression to wider criminal activity or a mix of illegitimate activity and legitimate business. Implications for future policing strategies and suggested additional research are outlined in response to these findings.\\n',\n",

However, despite such demands, governments from OECD countries as well as multilateral agencies that are engaged in fragile states often continue to act in an uncoordinated manner and fail to reach higher levels of harmonisation. Why is effective coordination so hard to achieve? This article argues that three major challenges explain the persistent problems of donor harmonisation in fragile states: (1) the cognitive challenge of explaining the origins of state fragility and deducing effective instruments and interventions; (2) the political challenge of reconciling divergent political motives for engagement; as well as (3) the bureaucratic challenge related to the organisational logic of competing aid agencies.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nThis article reexamines the venerable concept of indirect rule. We argue, drawing on evidence from colonial and postcolonial South Asia, that indirect rule actually represented a diverse set of governance forms that need to be clearly distinguished. Using a new typology of varieties of governance, we show that colonial governments established suzerain, hybrid, and de jure governance, in addition to direct rule across territories, based on the incentives and constraints of the state. The repertoire of governance forms narrowed and changed but did not disappear during decolonization, showing that the postcolonial state had powerful reasons to maintain forms of heterodox governance. Dramatic shifts, alongside enduring continuity, challenge a simple narrative of path dependence and the adherence to tradition, instead showing that governments have made conscious choices about how to govern. We conclude by discussing the implications of these arguments for broader understandings of state power.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nEven though the unequal reach of the state has become an important concern in the literature on developing democracies in Latin America, empirical measures of intracountry variation in state capacity are scarce. So far, attempts to develop valid measures of the reach of the state have often been hampered by inadequate data. Leveraging insights from national‐level scholarship, this article proposes a tax‐based measure to capture such intracountry variation. Drawing on a comprehensive data set of municipal finance and estimates of economic activity derived from nighttime lights, it maps state capacity in Ecuador. The article validates the measure on the basis of survey data collected by the Latin American Public Opinion Project. A multilevel analysis demonstrates that citizens tend to be more satisfied with the services provided by the state in municipalities with higher state capacity, which strengthens confidence that the measure picks up relevant differences.\\n',\n",

This primacy of the state rests on a global normative script that emphasizes the role of the modern state in providing collective goods and services from security to education to health. We analyze state performance in six dimensions of service delivery in a cross-sectional sample of more than 150 countries. In addition to exploring the explanatory power of statehood, we examine various control variables and also analyze whether external actors affect the delivery of collective goods and services. The core finding of this article is that there is remarkably little evidence of a consistent relationship between statehood and service delivery. This result casts doubt on the conventional wisdom about the centrality of the state for the provision collective goods and services, and suggests that other factors may explain the observed variation.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nThe decades‐old conflict in Mindanao, southern Philippines, is often framed as a Muslim–Christian conflict and reinterpreted as such within the US‐led global war on terror, with the Muslim secessionist movement standing accused of providing a hub for international jihad. In the meantime, global economic integration has made it easier to ignore the agrarian roots of violent conflict in Mindanao, enabling national and sub‐national actors, including the international community and the Muslim or Moro separatists, to dismiss the issue of agrarian justice. We counter these arguments by using an agrarian political economy framework to uncover the roots of resilient violence in Mindanao, using historical narratives of the region from the end of the nineteenth century that accentuate the links between state‐making, control of land and labour, and processes of agrarian modernization. We emphasize the critical role played by the Muslim landed elites who shaped processes of state‐making by brokering the interests of their clans with exogenous actors at the national and international level. We shed light on emerging state policies and competing interests among other landed and agribusiness elites that resulted in the spread of a parallel underground economy, renewing opportunities for violence and crime within semi‐autonomous social worlds.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstract\\nState formation in post‐colonial societies is often explained with reference to the roles of elites. In Pakistan, landed elites continue to dominate the rural political economy through informal and formal institutions, but the history of its largest peasant movement shows how agrarian class struggle can change the institutional forms and functions of power. The Hashtnagar peasant movement achieved lasting de facto land and tenancy reforms in north‐western Pakistan in the 1970s through forcible land occupations that were regularized by state intervention. I argue that although divisions among elites were important, the state intervened in favour of peasants due to the rising organizational power of tenants and landless labourers under the centralized leadership of the radical Mazdoor Kisan Party. Agrarian class struggle weakened the informal power of landed elites and gave rise to institutions of peasant power. However, other fractions of the ruling class sought to undermine their landed opponents while co‐opting the militancy of the peasant movement by strengthening state institutions to intervene in favour of upwardly mobile tenants. The latter were separated from poorer peasants and the landless, thus demobilizing the movement.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nThis paper examines the discourse of ‘shared responsibility’ that the governments of the United States and Mexico created through the 2008 Mérida Initiative. This discourse fixed the terms of an unruly debate that stood in the way of bilateral cooperation – are Mexico's drug cartels terrorists, and if so is Mexico in danger of failing? Specifically, the discourse does three things. First, it clarifies the formal position of both governments that Mexico's drug cartels are criminals, not insurgents. Second, by using the term ‘transnational criminal organisation’ (TCO) to label the cartels, the United State accepts some responsibility for them. Finally, the discourse establishes a territorial notion of sharing so that US participation inside Mexico is limited. Although ‘shared responsibility’ has been characterised as a ‘paradigm shift’ in how the two countries deal with one another (Benítez Manaut 2009, Revista\\u2005Mexicana de\\u2005Política\\u2005Exterior 87), I argue here that it reinforces a militarised status quo. By defining ‘shared responsibility’ as an obligation between states, the two countries do not have to articulate a joint responsibility to Mexico's civilians, who bear the brunt of both the cartels and the bilateral fight against them. This framing also helps explain the US government's muted response to abuses by the Mexican military since the agreement took effect.\\n\",\n",

The article contests this approach by focusing instead on militarism and militarisation.

Drawing on a range of authors from history, sociology and political science, the relationship is found to be reciprocal and symbiotic.

       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstract\\nThis paper is a preliminary comparative analysis of three polity‐seeking nationalisms that emerged in the contiguous peripheral areas – the overlapping ‘spheres of influence’ of three contending imperial centres: Taiwan, Okinawa and Hong Kong. Specifically, it examines and compares the pattern of nation‐formation and the form, ideology and politics of nationalism in each case, and in doing so it tries to suggest a possible explanatory framework for the rise of these nationalisms. Its tentative conclusion is that the rise of nationalism in Taiwan, Okinawa and Hong Kong should be understood as a macro‐historical sociological phenomenon caused by both the short‐term penetration from centralizing colonial and geopolitical centre(s) that triggered nationalist mobilization in the periphery and the long‐term process of peripheral nation‐formation that created the social basis for mobilization. The three cases also demonstrate some other traits of anti‐centre peripheral nationalism: they all adopted a similar ideological strategy of indigeneity, and all developed a differentiation between radical and pragmatic lines characteristic of minority or peripheral nationalisms. A final observation is that while the geopolitics of states in the region is powerfully shaping the development of the three nationalisms, interactions on the societal level may over time create a counterforce from below.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"\\nAbstract\\nThe politics of accommodation in multinational states sometimes features an important, yet often overlooked, fiscal dimension. In fact, the scholarly literature on the accommodation of nationalist movements emphasizes territorial autonomy, access to power and representation within central institutions, and the promotion of the state national identity, but it is virtually silent on how patterns of territorial fiscal redistribution, and more specifically programs of horizontal fiscal equalization, may contribute to accommodating sub‐state nationalism. This article looks at the Canadian case and analyses the multidimensional relationship between equalization policy and Québécois nationalism. It explains how a key motivation behind the creation of Canada's fiscal equalization program in 1957 was to “end” the institutional and political isolation of Québec and how equalization may have, thereafter, contributed to making Québec's secession less appealing to a good number of Quebeckers than it would have been in the absence of this program. Simultaneously, the article discusses how equalization may have contributed to a certain political backlash against Québec in the other provinces, thus providing mixed evidence in the assessment of the accommodation potential of equalization policy.\\n\",\n",

From this vantage point, it considers the power of alternative approaches in explaining the resilience or breakdown of autocratic regimes in the face of exogenously inspired protests. These explanations centre on the destabilizing impact of sudden economic downturns, the varied resilience of authoritarian subtypes, linkages to the outside world, the advantages of resource wealth and the threats posed by leadership successions. Drawing a deliberate comparison between these two waves of contention reveals several findings: first, structural factors such as resource wealth, monarchical political organization and weak political links to the outside made autocrats more resilient in the face of regional protest waves. Second, regimes temporarily undergoing leadership transitions were more vulnerable amidst regional waves.',\n",

In the model, entrepreneur capital is subject to extortion which affects both the extensive and intensive margins of entrepreneurship. Despite common property rights, extortion rates arise endogenously and are hump-shaped in entrepreneur ability. To discipline the quantitative analysis, the model is calibrated to match establishment-level evidence related to extortion in Poland and yields a number of implications broadly consistent with establishment-level facts in developing economies. For measures of property rights within a plausible range, output losses can be upwards of 10 percent.\\n',\n",

While previous work in the predatory theory tradition has often incorporated interdependent external influences, such as war and trade, it has often done so in a way that maintains a theoretical and empirical autonomy of the state. Theoretically, we suggest four mechanisms (coercion, competition, learning, and emulation) that operate to channel information through interstate rivalry and territorial contiguity, trade networks, and the political space associated with regime type and intergovernmental organization membership. We test our predictions using a multi-parametric spatiotemporal autoregressive model with four spatial lags capturing the four mechanisms. Our empirical results provide support for the coercion and learning mechanisms.  \\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nT he empirical literature that examines cross-national patterns of state repression seeks to discover a set of political, economic, and social conditions that are consistently associated with government violations of human rights. Null hypothesis significance testing is the most common way of examining the relationship between repression and concepts of interest, but we argue that it is inadequate for this goal, and has produced potentially misleading results. To remedy this deficiency in the literature we use cross-validation and random forests to determine the predictive power of measures of concepts the literature identifies as important causes of repression. We find that few of these measures are able to substantially improve the predictive power of statistical models of repression. Further, the most studied concept in the literature, democratic political institutions, predicts certain kinds of repression much more accurately than others. We argue that this is due to conceptual and operational overlap between democracy and certain kinds of state repression. Finally, we argue that the impressive performance of certain features of domestic legal systems, as well as some economic and demographic factors, justifies a stronger focus on these concepts in future studies of repression.\\n',\n",

Some countries were strong enough to resist colonization; others had enough state infrastructure that the colonizers would rule through existing institutions. Neither group therefore experienced institutional transplantation or European settlement. Less developed states, in contrast, were easier to colonize and were often colonized with institutional transplantation and an influx of settlers carrying ideals of parliamentarism. Using OLS and IV estimation, I present statistical evidence of an autocratic legacy of early statehood and document the proposed causal channel for a large sample of non-European countries. The conclusion is robust to different samples, different democracy indices, an array of exogenous controls, and several alternative theories of the causes and correlates of democracy.',\n",

Most states that can take and hold territory no longer appear eager to do so, while the weak are unable to expand. Have powerful countries become \"kinder and gentler,\" or has something fundamental changed about the logic of empire? We offer a theory of imperialism and decolonization that explains both historic cycles of expansion and decline and the demise of the urge to colonize. Technological shocks enable expansion, while military technology gradually disseminates, diluting imperial advantage. At the same time, economic development has led to a secular decline in the payoffs for appropriating land, minerals, and reluctant labor. Once conquest no longer pays for great powers, the systemic imperative to vertically integrate production also becomes archaic.\\n',\n",

Using novel data from urban Nigeria, where tax enforcement is weak, this article shows that individuals with a positive experience of state services delivery are more likely to express belief in an unconditioned citizen obligation to pay tax. In addition to support for this fiscal exchange mechanism, social context is consequential. Where individuals have access to community-provided goods, which may substitute for effective state services provision, they are less likely to adopt pro-compliance norms. Finally, the article shows that norm adoption increases tax payment. These findings have broad implications for literatures on state formation, taxation and public goods provision.',\n",

This article advances a theory of partisan trust discrimination in electoral democracies based on social identity, cognitive heuristics and interparty competition. Evidence from behavioral experiments in eight democracies show ‘trust gaps’ between co- and rival partisans are ubiquitous, and larger than trust gaps based on the social identities that undergird the party system. A natural experiment found that partisan trust gaps in the United States disappeared immediately following the killing of Osama bin Laden. But observational data indicate that partisan trust gaps track with perceptions of party polarization in all eight cases. Finally, the effects of partisanship on trust outstrip minimal group treatments, yet minimal-group effects are on par with the effects of most treatments for ascriptive characteristics in the literature. In sum, these findings suggest political competition dramatically shapes the salience of partisanship in interpersonal trust, the foundation of co-operation.',\n",

It conceptualizes the production of human rights practices as the outcome of two principal-agent relationships that constrain politicians and bureaucrats. Reliance on taxes is a non-electoral, fiscal factor that makes politicians more willing to protect human rights. Increased government revenue, no matter the source, raises bureaucratic compensation and helps create a more accountable bureaucracy. Thus both a higher reliance on taxes and larger state revenues lead to the better protection of human rights. Each fiscal factor promotes a different type of accountability, both of which independently contribute to good human rights practices.',\n",

This article argues that local sources of violence, particularly ethnic geography, affect peacekeeping effectiveness. Existing studies focus on the features of individual missions, yet curbing one-sided violence also depends on peacekeepers’ capacity to reduce the opportunities and incentives for violence. Moving from the idea that territorial control is a function of ethnic polarization, the article posits that peacekeepers are less effective against one-sided violence where power asymmetries are large (low polarization) because they (1) create incentives for escalation against civilians and (2) are less effective at separating/monitoring combatants. The UN mission in Sierra Leone from 1997 to 2001 is examined to show that UN troops reduce one-sided violence, but their effectiveness decreases as power asymmetries grow.',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nThe literature about global democracy deals with two different types of democratization: Type 1 is about spreading democracy across sovereign states as the basis for good governance. It focuses on the quality of the state/society-nexus: the balance between coercion, reward and identity. Type 2 is about democratizing world politics as such. In its most concrete expressions it focuses on the relationship between international society (a community of states) and world society (a community of people). The contemporary structure of multilevel governance provides the rationale behind this: national democracies are ineffective in controlling essential centres of power. This implies a need to scale up democracy to global proportions. However, in Type 1 considerations the term democracy often is an empty shell. This blinds observers for checks and balances and types of pluralism in non-democratic states. It also blinds them for misuse of democratic claims in democratic states. Aspiring global democracy in terms of Type 2 ignores that the presence of a central authority is a precondition inherent to the concept of democracy. Democratic theory cannot escape and is consequently caught up in its preconditions of a people (demos) and a government (cratos).\\n',\n",

       "   'title': 'An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa',\n",
       "   'abstract': '\\nAbstractA number of proposals today support a substantial increase in foreign aid levels to subSaharan Africa even though this region already receives a historically unprecedented volume of aid. This essay reviews the evidence regarding the potentially negative effects of aid dependence on state institutions, a topic which has received relatively little attention. We note several pathways through which political institutions might be adversely affected and devote particular attention to fiscal and state revenue issues. In addition to reviewing the economic literature on the aid-revenue relationship, this essay brings in the longstanding political science literature on state-building to consider the potential impact of aid dependence on the relationship between state and citizen. We conclude that states which can raise a substantial proportion of their revenues from the international community are less accountable to their citizens and under less pressure to maintain popular legitimacy. They are therefore less likely to have the incentives to cultivate and invest in effective public institutions. As a result, substantial increases in aid inflows over a sustained period could have a harmful effect on institutional development in sub-Saharan Africa.\\n',\n",

To do so, it presents and critically assesses four methods that can be used to determine who and/or what counts as a part of any international practice: the agreement method, which locates a practice by referring to speech acts that define it; the contextual method, which locates a practice by referring to the actions, meanings, and intentions of practitioners; the value method, which locates a practice by identifying a value or principle that the practice reflects or instantiates; and the purpose method, which locates a practice by constructing an account of the sociopolitical reason(s) for a practice's existence. The purpose method, based on an interpretation of Rawls' constructivism, is developed, in a way that focuses on practitioners' judgement-based reasons to assign responsibility for human rights to any state or non-state actor.\\n\",\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nInstitutional democratization has made considerable progress in the history of the European Union (EU). Mainstream theories of democratization, however, fail to capture this process because they are wedded to the nation-state context. This paper therefore proposes a transformationalist theory of democratization beyond the state. EU democratization results from the conflict about the redistribution of political competences between institutional actors in a multilevel system, in which liberal democracy is the shared norm of legitimate authority. To the extent that institutional actors, who push for further integration in order to increase efficiency, undermine existing democratic institutions at the national level, their competitors can put into question the legitimacy of integration by invoking the shared liberal democratic community norms and shame them into making democratic concessions. The normative origins of democracy in the EU are illustrated in case studies on democratic membership conditionality, legislative rights of the European Parliament, and the institutionalization of human rights in the EU.\\n',\n",

       "   'abstract': '\\nThis paper develops a predatory theory approach to understanding state failure. Predatory theory expects that state revenue extraction is central to the ability of states to engage in any other activities. States that are able to maximize their revenue extraction subject to well-known constraints are therefore likely to avoid state failure. On the other hand, when state failure occurs, it should reduce state revenue extraction. These hypotheses receive mixed support in several two-stage least-squares time-series analyses that control for the endogenous relationship between state fiscal capacity and state failure. While state failure reduces state fiscal capacity, state fiscal capacity does not deter state failure onset or incidence. In the sub-Saharan African subsample, state fiscal capacity does reduce the incidence of state failure despite a reciprocal negative effect.\\n',\n",
